# ✈️ Flight Search POC – An AI-Driven Development Journey 🤖

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **production-ready backend for a flight search platform**, built entirely in under 2 hours through **AI-driven development**. It demonstrates how modern AI tools can rapidly transform a product idea into a fully containerized, scalable microservice.

**Core Capabilities**:

* REST APIs for flight ingestion
* Real-time Elasticsearch indexing
* Fast, paginated search with filters by city, date range, and sorting by price

**Tech Stack**:

* Java 17, Spring Boot 3
* PostgreSQL
* Elasticsearch
* Maven
* Swagger UI
* Docker & Docker Compose

---

## 📘 What It Does

* Accepts flight data via REST and stores it in PostgreSQL
* Indexes flight data in Elasticsearch for real-time searchability
* Exposes a search API with:

  * Departure/arrival city filters
  * Departure date filtering
  * Price sorting
  * Pagination support
* Swagger UI for API exploration

## 🧠 The AI-Driven Development Journey

### 🧩 Phase 1: Prompt Engineering (5 mins)

**Initial Prompt to O3 Model**:

> “We are creating a flight search platform where users can search flights... need tech spec for Java/Maven with 2 components...”

**O3's Contribution**:

* Refined vague requirements into a structured spec
* Defined:

  * Architecture: Ingestion ➝ Search flow
  * Tech constraints: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
  * Deliverables: REST APIs, Docker setup, test coverage

---

### 📄 Phase 2: Technical Specification (10 mins)

**Refined Prompt → O4-Mini-High**

Generated a complete **18-section tech spec** with:

* ASCII architecture diagram
* DB schemas and Elasticsearch mappings
* REST API specs (endpoints, status codes)
* Implementation steps
* Test cases and acceptance criteria

---

### 💻 Phase 3: Code Implementation with Cursor (90 mins)

**Human + AI Pair Programming** highlights:

* **Maven**: Multi-module → single JAR for easy deployment
* **JPA**: Entities, repositories, validation annotations
* **Service Layer**: Retry logic, DTO mapping, exception handling
* **Controllers**: Ingestion, Search, Health endpoints
* **Swagger**: Auto-generated API docs
* **Config**: Environment-specific setup
* **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile + Compose orchestration

---

### ⚙️ Phase 4: Real-time Problem Solving (15 mins)

AI resolved issues like:

* Duplicate Spring Boot apps → Cleaned up Application classes
* Incorrect DB column mapping → Fixed `@Column(name = "_id")`
* Elasticsearch date format errors → Switched to ISO-8601
* Docker env var issues → Corrected naming & retry logic for ES indexing

---

## 🤝 AI + Human Collaboration

| Role      | Responsibilities                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human** | Product vision, architectural choices, debugging                 |
| **AI**    | Code generation, error resolution, documentation, best practices |

---

## 🏆 Key Achievements in <2 Hours

### ✅ Features

* Idempotent ingestion
* Graceful error handling
* Health checks
* Real-time Elasticsearch sync
* Interactive Swagger UI

### ✅ Developer Experience

* One-command deployment:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
* Structured logs
* Clean modular code
* Containerized services with health checks

### ✅ Technical Robustness

* Retry mechanisms (e.g., for ES connection)
* Configurable via environment variables
* Validated DB schema and ES mappings

---

## 🎯 The Result

A fully working, containerized flight search backend—ready for production and built **start-to-finish in 120 minutes**.

This project exemplifies:

* 🚀 **AI-assisted velocity** in software development
* 🧱 **Clean architecture** and separation of concerns
* 🔧 **Operational readiness** with Docker Compose

> *AI accelerates execution. Humans shape the vision.*
> This is the future of software development.
